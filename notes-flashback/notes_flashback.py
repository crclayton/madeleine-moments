# notes-flashback

# This program sends an email to me once a day containing a
# page from my old notes. It creates a flashback, reminding
# me of a lecture/concept that I might have forgotten about
# without the review. Alternatively, if I look at the notes
# and have no recollection of them, it'll signal to me that
# I need to review a topic.
