# madeleine moments

This is a Python script to randomly email me a page from my old notes everyday. It's a nice way to passively review old material. Some mornings I'll see the page and think, Oh yeah, I remember that and this flood of memories and knowledge will all start coming back to me. Other mornings, I'll see the page and think Hmm, I don't have such a good recollection of that, but my curiosity will be peaked and I'll end up looking into it.
